# Session Summaries
### Session 0.5 - 10
14th of the Thrilling month, 504 PA
Magic Team met in Seulo, fought the beginnings of the Whispered Ones, and set out for Arden.
We arrived in Arden, Brother Mil and Tyll told us about kidnapped children. We met Jean, the leader of the Whispered Ones there, and Abrasax found us a job clearing out their Villa in the south of Arden, which was overrun by the Dyad. We found weird necromancy circles and runes in an unknown language (later revealed to be Ancestral). We also first heard about missing children through posters.
Met Sephyros Apollus in Arden to show him the Ancestral runes, and he went with us on our journey to M'Kun. On the way, we met Fritz, an Occultatum wizard, just trying to find his way through the desert, looking for a tomb? or rune.
We stopped on our way to M'Kun in Woestyn, found a bounty board, and found a ghost (Amala) that has been haunting a farm and city. Abrasax starts exploring his psychic abilities, by connecting with the ghost. We defeated the ghost, found her child, claimed some loot, and went back to the inn. There, Seph was gone, and he left us our starting items.
On our way to M'Kun, we found a farm overrun by mummies raised my a twisted version of Danse Macabre, an outlawed spell used to raise dead, seemingly in a ritual for Mykrul. [Could be for Malphyos Shinru?]
Once there, we were hired by the Whispered Ones again, this time to go disable a Dyad boat (Dunerak) in the bay. We looked around the city to find Drake Vakarian, someone from Abrasax's history, who is a smuggler and may know about the missing children. Fought through the boat, Tyll died, and we found tied TP circle portals to (somewhere near) Arden, the Great Mesa, and Koradun.
Firen met Valanthe Celethril in the city, while the rest went to talk to Drake. 
Drake told Abrasax that he's probably looking for the High Priest of Occultism, Wymar Alips. (And a few weeks ago, Seph told Abrasax to find the "Tower where the sun rises").
